python packages:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages

a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the moduleâ€™s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.

The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages 

__all__ : if defined, all submodules will be imported from the parent packaging when douin from package import *

1. Create a project: 
django-admin startproject mysite

2. Create an app:
python manage.py startapp polls

3. Add the view with the name (the endpoint).if "" as first argument, it is the default view

4. Add the url to the app

5. Add the url to the project

6. create and migrate  all the apps with database (list in installed apps in settings.py) with the command python manage.py migrate

7. check the database. if SQLite, use the command python manage.py dbshell

8. once in the shell, you can use SQL commands to check the database (e.g. .tables to see the tables)

9. create a model in the app

10. create the migration file with the command
' python manage.py makemigrations polls (makemigration = update)'

Other commands:
 'python manage.py check' = check for problems in the project without making migrations'
 'python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001' = check the SQL code that will be executed
 'python manage.py shell' = open the python shell

11. create an admin superuser
'python manage.py createsuperuser'

12. add the model to the admin interface (in the app admin.py)
